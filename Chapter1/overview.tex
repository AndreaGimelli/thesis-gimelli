\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The manuscript is structured as follows. Chapter~\ref{ch:background} resumes the
relevant background notions for elevator systems, neural networks and the main
techniques employed. In the first part, Chapter~\ref{ch:elevator_model} details
the modeling of elevator systems with variables, constraints and objectives and
Chapter~\ref{ch:elevator_enc} enumerates the different encodings that we propose
for replacing the current engine. After showcasing the web application for 
elevator design in Chapter~\ref{ch:liftcreate}, in Chapter~\ref{ch:experiments_design}
we show our experimental campaign for the search of a new declarative encoding.

In the second part we focus on neural networks, and we meticulously detail the
abstraction algorithms in Chapter~\ref{ch:abstraction}. Then we detail the tools
we developed in order to foster research and collaboration in Chapter~\ref{ch:never2}
and we collect the results of this topic in Chapter~\ref{ch:experiments_nn}.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions} concludes the Thesis and sheds some light on
possible future research perspectives.
