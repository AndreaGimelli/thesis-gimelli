The work presented in this Thesis would have never been possible without
the support and the teaching of my supervisor Armando Tacchella, I am
forever grateful for his utmost dedication and infinite patience. I also wish
to thank all my colleagues in the lab: Marco Menapace introduced me to the world
of elevators and helped me learn a ton about software development in practice, 
along with Giuseppe Cicala; Dario Guidotti on the other hand helped me 
understand the new context of neural networks and his work clearly and patiently.
Frosina, Francesco, Massimo: our exchanges, fruitful and trivial, relieved 
the stress and fatigue. A special thanks to Luca Pulina and Danilo Calzetta, 
who supported me while preparing the admission.

I extend my gratitude to all the researchers I met during my last year, when
it was finally possible to travel again after the COVID-19 pandemic: Prof. Dritan
Nace who welcomed me at Universitè de Technologie de Compiègne, Guillaume Joubert
who proposed new ideas, Joelle Al Hage with the valuable discussions we held and
Stephane, Philippe, Maxime, Remy, Antoine, Thibault, Lyes, Sana, Ling, Soundouss 
and everyone I shared coffee and ideas with.

Last, but not least, I thank my family and friends who were always there during
this journey, supporting and helping me. Erica, my beloved, who endured as much as
me the weight of this work and still is crazy enough to try and start to be a 
researcher too. The whole San Giorgio Fight Team, a family before a sport team.
All of you are very near and dear to me.
